            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="question"> Do I need to be good at drawing?</div>
                <div class="answer">Nope! This is digital art - we've got UNDO buttons and magic tools. If you can doodle a stick figure, you're already qualified. Plus, 3D printing is more about cool shapes than drawing skills!</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="question">Can I keep the stuff I 3D print?</div>
                <div class="answer">YES! Unless it's a school project we're displaying, your creations go home with you. Warning: Your parents' shelves may become overcrowded with tiny dragons and custom keychains.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="question"> What if I break something?</div>
                <div class="answer">We've all clicked the wrong button and made our artwork disappear (Ctrl+Z is your BFF). The printers are tougher than they look, and Mr./Ms. [Your Name] is here to help when tech gets feisty.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="question"> Do we get to use the fancy computers?</div>
                <div class="answer">Absolutely! Our lab has all the good stuff - drawing tablets, 3D printers, and software that professionals use. Just please don't stick gum under the keyboards (weirdly specific because it's happened).</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="question">Can I use my phone/tablet?</div>
                <div class="answer">For taking reference photos? Yes! For texting? Nope. But you'll be so busy making cool stuff, you might forget to check your notifications anyway.</div>
            </div>
            
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="question"> Is there a lot of homework?</div>
                <div class="answer">Most work happens in class since we need the special equipment. Sometimes you might need to sketch ideas at home, but we call that "fun doodling time" instead of homework.</div>
