                    <div class="answer">A: While there is a grade taken for how well you solve the problem and if it works. The impact this has on your overall grade in the class is minimal. That being said I will look for a clear plan and build up to your final design and how well you followed your plan. Aswell as did you make meaningfull improvements for prototype two.
