    <h3>My Favorites consist of...</h3>
    <br>

        <li>Portal</li>
        <li>Deadlock</li>

        <li>Portal 2</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>I like these games because they all give mass amounts of nostalgia everytime I play them. When I first saw someone play Half Life 2 I knew I had to get it. luckily enough my dad had both games on his steam account so then I could play. Years later I saw that the entire Half life series was on sale and I begged my dad to get it for me. I've played every Half life game and beat all of them. (Besides Half Life Alyx, That game is hard.) I've also played both Portal games and even became a play tester for Deadlock, Team fortress 2 was a great game aswell! All of these Valve Games are amazing and I suggest playing some of them at some point. Valve hasnt made a game in awhile but now they seem to be coming back with Deadlock and possibly more!</p><br> <h3>Extras</h3> <br> <p>Did you know, for a game as old as half life, The average amount of players playing it is 845.4 players! Crazy right? </p> <br> <p>Did you know, Portal originally had a different ending? after beating glados you would send a portal out of a hole that would appear in the roof. after entering the portal you would go into a tunnel that would lead to zen? Portal and Half life are a connected universe but with small references to eachother. but now we have full proof they are!</p>
