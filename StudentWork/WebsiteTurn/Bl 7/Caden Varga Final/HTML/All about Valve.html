    <p>This website was created to serve as almost like a documentary on Valve and its story, (please note i am very young and I probably won't get some things right.) Valve is a great company (in my opinion) and not many people really know too much about it, but I want to show it recognition. Some people may also know it from "Steam". Steam is the website where most people go to play indie games, games cross platform, and Multiplayer games, I even use it myself. </p> <h4>Everything in this website was taken off of wikipidea so things may not be truthful.</h4> </div> 
    <div class="Extra"> <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>I was introduced to Valve at a very young age (4-5) Since then i've grasped onto their games and i've almost played all of them. Because I love the company and all of its games I wanted to create an entire website about almost everything about it! The company puts lots of effort into their games, I mean look at Half life 2 for example: it has amazing graphics that are so old yet so advanced that it looks almost realistic, they also allow users to make their own games, mods, and edit their existing props and stuff like that. Some people believe they gave up on they're game creating though there is more to come, Half life still has concluded neither has portal (It might have concluded but because half life and portal are in the same universe there might be more to come with portal.) </p> </div>
    <div class="Extra2"> <h2>Extra Stuff</h2>
    <p>This Website was created for a graded assignment and there most probably won't be too many updates, If I have the chance to update it I will its not expected.</p></div>

 <h2>Secrets?</h2>
 <br>
 <p>Ah secrets, the one thing video games always have. (sometimes), Without secrets what is a game? Just because I truly love secrets I decided to add some secrets, pretty cool? <br> <h3>What to expect</h3> <br> <p>In total i'm planning on adding 10 secrets but it might change, you should expect secret messages you can click on or even lines from games made by valve!</p> 
 </div>
 <div class="Four"> <h2>Example</h2> <br> <p>Here are an example of texts you might see that are secrets "Half life is a great game so good its making me want to Scream "Hello Gordan!"" or, "Valve has had many great games such as, <a href="SecretPage0.html">Team Fortress 2</a> " I don't really have a Valid reason for doing this I just want to have fun and get a good grade in this class so I'm doing all this.</p</div>
