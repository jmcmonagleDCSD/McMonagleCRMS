<p>Here is where my first farm is and also my third ever farm is.</p>
<div class="intro1">
    <p>In this farm it is a very large sugar beet farm.</p>

<div class="sugarbeetstuff">
    <p>First off, when you make a sugar beet farm you have to have and planter or seeder</p>

    <p>Then you need a cultivater or plow</p>
    <img src="../images/plow.png" alt="plow" width="30%">
    <p>When your done with that then you harvest the sugar beet with your sugar beet combine. There are two of the sugar beet combines sometimes you can put one on the back of your trailer or just do the one that I have below (not the one that connects to your own tractor)</p>
