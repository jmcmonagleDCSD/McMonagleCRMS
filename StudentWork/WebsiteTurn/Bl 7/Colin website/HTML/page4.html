    <p>With chickens you dont have to do much but if you have the chicken pen with a building it gets its own water but if you have the chicken pen with no building then you have to get your own water or drom a water silo.</p>

    <p>When you feed them you get eggs and with that you can load them up onto a flat bead trailer and haul them to a sore that buys it and you get a profit</p>
