            <h1>Spongebob</h1>
            <p>This website is about sponegbob and all things related to him. Quotes, Merchandise, and his voice actor will all be listed here (and maybe a few other things too) now lets start with spongebob himself! (This page is on sea level.)</p>
            <p>Spongebob is the classic sponge that lives in a pineapple under the sea. He is a very outgoing sponge with autism (I bet you didn't know that) but that doesn't change him! He is friends with patrick (Who won't be referenced anywhere else because this is about spongebob NOT patrick). The two love to hang out together and go on wacky adventures (Jelly fishing obviously being the favorite activity) His voice actor is Tom Kenny who plays a bunch of other characters in tv shows. You might have heard one of his other characters without knowning it was him! Tom is a very outgoing person and is willing to do almost anything if its about spongebob. He really cherishs spongebob and it makes sense why.</p>

        <!--Stop reading this if you don't like finding secrets. Mr. Mc Monagle gets a pass. If you see this then you have inspected the website or are looking at the pages for a grade. The reason you are reading this for inspecting this is because I wanted to point out the theme of the website. Every page is getting darker to make a theme that we are going deeper under the ocean and the deeper we are the bigger/more secret(s) there are on a page. Welp with that being said, good luck finding those secrets! Oh and uh highlighting a whole page might help you find them.-->
