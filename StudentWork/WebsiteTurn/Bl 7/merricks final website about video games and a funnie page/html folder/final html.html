            <h1>Why did video games even become a thing? Well In October of 1958 a man of Physicist William Higinbotham created what is thought to be the first video game. It was a very simple tennis game, similar to the classic 1970s video game Pong, and it was quite a hit at a Brookhaven National Laboratory open house.
                which was the curiousity of thousands of game platformers to create games to depend on pongs coding even tho pong had no coding team the Physicist tried to create a valueable code to organize that the thousand's of game owners could rely on for later to be the video game community.
