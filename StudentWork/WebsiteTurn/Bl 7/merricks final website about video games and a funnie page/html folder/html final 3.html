        Also some of the things about video games is that i have lots and lots and lots of video games that i like to lay on a basis... 
        Every sicne i started to take computer science i took a bunch of games scrapped them to a very end to find if they actually even consisted of html or css.
        Which ive been very busy on :). But after scrapping them i still havent found any codes from css or html BUTTT i did find that in homepages or screenplay's that they have about 4 pages of it per game which is pretty good.
        Alot of game dev's do not have like playscreens which is where you click play or etc... And instead just log or go straight into it. (which i like if its instant so i can just grind it faster :) )
