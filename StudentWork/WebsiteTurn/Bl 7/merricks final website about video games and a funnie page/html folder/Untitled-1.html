<div class="game">
    <h1>most games are mostly found in the playstore or on a multistaged platform off of google or of the web such as firefox safari and google etc... but you can also find games just by having no internet and going on google</h1>
</div>

<div class="extinct">
    <h1>Games are also coded to much to actually understand for people who literally just started coding so id suggest you take classes or learn on youtube or khan academy to learn about how to code to create games like the philosopher.
        <br> for example you can also think of how to code. What I mean by that is to look at length's or distances of games or to find a specific spot to start at and build it off there. To many coders that are begginers think they cant just build a game with a block and some jibble jabble typing. But in reality you need tons of research formatting experience learning and even just thinking.
