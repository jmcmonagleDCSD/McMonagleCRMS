<h1>All about dirt bikes</h1>
<h2>1. Dirt Bikes Originated In The United Kingdom.</h2>
<p>The modern dirt bike traces its history to the British-made BSA. 
This off-road motorcycle became the leading model in the United States 
once motocross became popular across the pond.</p>

<h2>2. The First Dirt Bike Races Started Decades Ago.</h2>
<p>Today's motocross is thought to have evolved from the United Kingdom's 
1909 Auto Cycle quarterly trial event. In the 1920s, dirt bike racing events 
began popping up across the United Kingdom. In the 1950s, the racing trend made 
its way to the United States. In 1972, the first stadium race was held in the LA Coliseum.</p>

<h2>3. It Didn't Take Long For Japanese Dirt Bike Manufacturers To Dominate The Market.</h2>
<p>Dirt bikes may have begun in the United Kingdom, but that region soon lost its dominance. 
Starting in the 1970s, Japanese motorcycle manufacturers became the leading dirt bike creators - which still are today. 
The dirt bike leaders include Yamaha®, Honda®, Kawasaki®, and Suzuki®.</p>

<h1>The Dirt Bike Design</h1>
<h2>4. Chainsaws Are Often More Powerful Than A Dirt Bike.</h2>
<p>It may sound bizarre, but it's true! Dirt bike engines can be as small as 50cc and even the largest ones tend to be below 500cc. 
These lower powered engines suit the dirt bike need well. After all, these motorcycles are made for off-road riding, which focuses on 
simply harnessing enough power to push over bumps and hills...not speed down the freeway.</p>

<h2>5. Dirt Bikes Are Lightweight.</h2>
<p>Since weight is the enemy of speed, dirt bikes are built lightweight. 
Many models are under 200 pounds thanks to lightweight materials such as aluminum frames, aluminum wheels, plastic fenders, plastic panels, 
and so on.</p>

<h2>6. Dirt Bikes Are Often The Easiest Motorcycle Type To Customize.</h2>
<p>Dirt bikes are stripped down and lack any unnecessary parts. This lends itself to a simple design, 
which is easy to personalize and alter with aftermarket accessories.</p>

<h2>7. Dirt Bikes Are Taller Than Other Motorcycles.</h2>
<p>Many dirt bikes have 12 to 13 inches of front and rear suspension. 
This boosts their suspension travel, improves the ride's smoothness, 
increases the model's ability to absorb shock from landing, 
and makes riding easier on the motorcycle and the rider.</p>

<h1>The Dirt Bike Riding Experience</h1>
<h2>8. You Cannot Take A Dirt Bike "As-Is" Onto A Paved Road.</h2>
<p>Dirt bikes lack important safety features, such as headlights, brake lights, rearview mirrors, and turn signals. 
They also emit a high amount of exhaust and usually do not meet emission standards.</p>

<h2>9. Dirt Bike Riding Is A Great Workout.</h2>
<p>Instead of hitting the gym, go for a dirt bike ride. 
    Controlling an off-road motorcycle burns calories, strengthens muscles, improves posture.</p>
