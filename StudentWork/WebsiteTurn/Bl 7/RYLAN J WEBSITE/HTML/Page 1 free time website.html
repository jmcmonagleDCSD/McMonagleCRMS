Once you reach levle 700, then you will be able to go to the second sea. Once in the second sea, you will have new quests and new and cooler islands where the quests are. Once you reach levle 1,500, you can go to the finle sea, sea three. when you get to the third sea, you will start levling up just like all of the other sea. The max levle is 2,550, and there is so much more to the game. But ill stick to just the fruits.  </h3>
