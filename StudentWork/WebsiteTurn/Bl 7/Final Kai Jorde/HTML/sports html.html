<h1>Sports</h1>

<p>I like to play sports because they make me happy and i also have ADHD so i do not like to sit for too long. My favorite sport is golf because ive been playing it for a while and ive gotten pretty good at it. Also, another thing i like is cross country. In the CRMS cross country season i won the first the three meets then i got third at districts.</p></div>

<h1>Cross country</h1>
<p>Another one of my favorite sports is cross country. In the CRMS cross country season i won the first the three meets then i got third at districts. One thing i really like about cross country is winning. I also really like beating and passing people in races. But the one hard thing about cross country is training and doing workouts for running.</p></div>

<p>The Green bay packers aer my favorite NFL team. One thing i really want to happen this year is that the packers win the super bowl. One of the thing i really like about the packers is the colors. Some of my favorite colors are green and yellow.</p>
