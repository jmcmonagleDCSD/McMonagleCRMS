<h2>About bats</h2>

<p>Bats are small bird like creatures that normally are only seen at night or in caves. The bats that most people think of are vampire bats and bats that harm people but most bats in the world are very friendly towards humans. Bats have a really long life span and do not even need to eat for days while hibbernating they can survive up to 24 hours without food however bats can live without food for months normally bats will not do this. This choice is made up by the bat's so incase of bad weather they can hide for months at a time and wait till they can hunt again. Bats are one of the only 450 animals that are insectiovorses so they eat plants fruit blood and even fish! </p>

<h2>What they are</h2>
<p>Not like the bats we use in games the small  bird like mammals bats have been on planet earth for 50 millon years!!! these bird like mammals have been around the same time as the Palaeoloxodon namadicus and the Stegodon namadicux those are the 2 biggest species of elephants. Now bats have been called vampire bats while there is a vampire bat they do not really suck blood for a living they do feed off blood but it is not there go to meal they will normally eat berries fruits and fish as a normale meal for most bats as there are many different diets for bats. Bats are nocturnal so they will always be seen at night and never in day light unless awoken because they sleep during the day and hunt in the night because there vison is better then poeple say it is like the term "blind as a bat" and they can see in the dark and hunt for food while hiding from predators. While people think bats will be active, loud, dangerous as pets but they are very calm while awake and sleeping they do not attack humans as many people think they do.</p>

<h2>How they fly</h2>
<p>Many people do not know this but bats fly almost exactly like a flying squirle and a bird they glide like a squirle and flap like a bird and they can reach incredible speeds up to 100 miles per hour!! This means that bats can go the same speed of a normale regular every day car while diving now they can go even faster then a normal car reaching speeds up 120 miles per hour but when swiping for food they shall normally dive at speeds like 20-30 MPH these bats have simmarlar structure of a flying squirle</p>
