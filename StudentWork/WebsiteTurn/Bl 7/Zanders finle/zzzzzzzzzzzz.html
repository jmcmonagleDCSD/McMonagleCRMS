        <h3>Ferdinand Porsche, the eponymous founder of the company, made the world's first hybrid electric vehicle… in 1899. The Lohner-Porsche “Semper Vivus” was essentially an electric car with an internal combustion motor used as a generator. It was also the first car with brakes on all four wheels.</h3>
