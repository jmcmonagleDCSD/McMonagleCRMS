            <h1>The Nether</h1>
            <p>The Nether has a massive revamp and a lot more structures to explore like the Soul Forge or the Burning Arena.
                 There are also a whole lot of biomes that you can find like a biome where you can find some Rose Quartz instead of normal Quartz.
                  There are also a lot more mobs- For example there is a bear that hangs on the ceiling and jumps you when you are under it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="End">
            <h1>The End</h1>
            <p>The End is the place you go after to beat the game even though there are bosses at least 9 times as hard as the Ender Dragon but anyway.
                 The End also has a cool revamp but it's the outer islands you should see but sadly End Ships are twice as hard to find but give you a fully enchanted elytra.
                  There are plenty of biomes to explore in this revamp of the End including a lot of new mobs that are mosty friendly but some are very aggresive. You can find a Ruined Citadel that holds the Ender Guardian and Ender Golems and are not friendly at all b</p>
