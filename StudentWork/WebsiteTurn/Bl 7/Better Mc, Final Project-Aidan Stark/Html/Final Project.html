        <h1>Better Minecraft</h1>
        <p>Better Minecraft adds a ton of new things to Minecraft including new bosses, new mobs, new blocks, new weapons,
            and a whole lot of other things. We are gonna be taking a look at most of them.
             This is a modpack on CurseForge and Modrinth and other Modclients so it's just a bunch of mods stringed together.
            There are also new dimensions including the Aether, Everbright, Everdawn, and the Twilight Forest.
            Some dimensions are harder than the Nether. Mostly the Everbright, Everdawn, and the Deeper and Darker.
             There are also different armour types which some are even stronger than Netherite but we'll cover that topic on a whole other page.
              There are 2 version but we're only covering "Better Minecraft(Forge)-BMC4" The other version is Fabric which is also cool, so go check it out.
               You can do anything in Better Minecraft including make Uncrafting Tables which uncraft any item you find. You even have quests you can do for rewards and xp   </p>
