   <h4> This is an image of all the main upgrades you can get.</h4>
  
   <h2> <p>
    I,m only going to say a few upgrades here just because of how many upgrades there are so lets get started.
    <br>
    first upgrade is the amount of click points per click thats the green gem looking upgrade
    <br>
    second upgrade is the the clicks per second thats the one that hase the three gears in it
    <br>
    third is the gems all they do is spawn on the map and if you blast them with your nerf bullets you colect them.
    <br>
    fourth the health boost this just gives you more max or heals you up 50 persent health. (it will only heal you if you get dameged.)
    <br>
    and finally the big heart this is different from the fourth one because this one spawns on the map <br> and it fully heals you
      </p>
