    <h4>One of the primary reasons that tigers are endangered is poaching and illegal wildlife trade. Tigers are often hunted for their pelts, bones, teeth, and claws, which are then sold on the black market. In some cultures, tiger parts are believed to have medicinal properties or are used as status symbols.</h4>

<p>If your wanting to help tigers from going extinct you can do multiple things by helping. As an example you can donate to special tiger organizations as listed below or you don't ever have to spend any money and you can just pick up your trash and maybe protest to stop people from poaching. And if you don't feel like doing any of that maybe tell your family how bad poaching is to endangered animals. Or even promoting/buying tiger-friendily facilities would help and get the tiger population up and going. These are ways you can help tigers from going fully extinct and as a community we can help all kinds of tigers.</p>
