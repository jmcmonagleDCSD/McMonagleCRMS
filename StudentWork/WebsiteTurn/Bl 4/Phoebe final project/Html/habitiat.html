                <p class="habitat"> Sea turtles live in most of the oceans in the world, exept in cold polar seas.
                They tend to spend most of there lives in sallow continental shelf waters. Once 
                they mature, males never leave their ocean home, but females go to the beach to 
                lay eggs-usually the same beach where they hatched as babies.</p>
