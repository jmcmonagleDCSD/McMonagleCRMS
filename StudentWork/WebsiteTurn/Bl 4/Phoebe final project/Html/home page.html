            <h2>Threats</h2>
            <p> Threats to sea turtles include damage to nesting, accidental capture while fishing, 
            and being hit by boats. One way that NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminostration) 
            has reduced this threat was by developing TED (turtle exculder devices). A TED is a grid of 
            bars at the bottom or top of a shrimp net, angled with a flap at the top. This makes it so 
            that if a turtle accidentally get caught in the net, they can escape through a TED flap.</p>

                <h2>Nesting</h2>
                <p>Although sea turtles spend most of their lives in the ocean, adult female turtles return 
                to beaches to lay eggs. They usually do this at night. Females crawl out of the ocean, and 
                pause frequently as if she's scoping out her spot. She then finds a dry part of the beach 
                and flings lose peices of sand away with her flippers. by digging with her flipers and 
                rotating her body, she construts a "body pit". Once the body pit is conplete, she uses 
                her cupped rear flippers as shovels to dig an egg cavity. This egg cavity is shaped a 
                little bit like a tear drop and is usually slightly tilted. When the turle is finished 
                digging the egg chamber, she starts to lay her eggs.</p>
