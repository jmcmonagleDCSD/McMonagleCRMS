<h2> Introduction</h2>
<p> Baseball is a classic American sport that has entertained countless people of all ages and across 
    several continents. There are youth leagues, the Minor Leagues, and the prestigous Major Leagues. 
    There are even leagues of baseball for toddlers as old as 3. The sport itself was born from the 
    humblest of beginnings in a rural New York town. From there it grew across the country and into 
    Canada then earning the name "America's Favorite Pastime". Then it gained popularity in many 
    European countries, eventually making its way all the way to Japan. Six out of seven continents 
    play baseball competitively, or even just for simple fun. Baseball has made it's way into the 
    lives of many today, and will continue to do so sometime far into the future. The simplicity 
    of the game mixed with the complexity of the game makes it the perfect sport for people everywhere 
    and of any age.</p>
