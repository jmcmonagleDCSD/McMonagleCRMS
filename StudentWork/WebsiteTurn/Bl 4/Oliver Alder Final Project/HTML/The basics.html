<h2>What Do They Do?</h2>
<p>When a team is on defense, there are nine players placed in special positions around the diamond-shaped field 
    that are all working together to try and get the opposing teams' players out while they are up to bat. 
    In the numerical positon of 1, there is the pitcher. The pitcher stands exactly 43 feet directly in front of 
    home plate on a mound that is shaped kind of like a doorstop. The pitcher's job is to strike out the batters 
    of the opposing team. Next, number 2 is called the catcher. The catcher stand right behind the plate just far 
    enough so that the batter won't hit him with the bat. The catcher's job is to catch all of the pitches that 
    the pitcher throws for the batter to hit. Then there's number 3, the first baseman, who stands at the first 
    base, 90 feet from home and directly to the right of the pitcher's mound from a home plate view. If the ball 
    is hit into play by the batter, the runner has to run to first base as the rest of the fielders try and get 
    the ball to the first baseman to get the batter out. The first baseman has to be touching the base in some 
    way to get the out. Then it's position number 4, the second baseman, who stands at second base, 90 feet from 
    first base, 127 feet away from home plate, and behind the pitchers mound. The second baseman has the job of 
    either getting the ball to the first basemen, or if the batter at first is not out, the second baseman can 
    have the ball thrown to him for an out at second base, and if there's time he can throw the ball back to 
    first for another out and what's called a "double play", meaning they got two batters out in one play of the 
    ball. Next is position number 5, the third basemen, who stands at third base, 90 feet from home and second, 
    and to the left of the pitcher's mound. The third basemen essentially has the same job on the field as the 
    second basemen. Positions 6, 7, and 8 are left field, right field, and center field respectively. If the 
    ball is hit into the outfield, it is the outfielders job to get the ball back into the infield as fast as 
    possible to stop an advance of the runners.</p>
