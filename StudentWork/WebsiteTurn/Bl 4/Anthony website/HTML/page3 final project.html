                <hr><hr>
                <p>Red Bull is one of the best teams because of one of their best drivers max verstappen. and one of their best engineers adrian newey who has now left red bull for aston martin and ever since he left the red bull team has not been doing so well in qualifying and the main races.<br> but they are still a good team usualy finishing in top three and sometimes lower. </p>
