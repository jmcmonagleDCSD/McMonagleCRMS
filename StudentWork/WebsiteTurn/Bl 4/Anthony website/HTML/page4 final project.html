            <p>the mclaren F1 team is a good team that has been winning most races. and having a major gap on the other drivers. mclaren has been accused of cheating by most F1 fans because they use a mini drs effect which means drag reduction system. so the car can have faster straight line speed. which makes the other drivers fall behind further and further which is what makes that huge gap. but overall besideds that they are a decent team. featureing lando norris and ocar piastri as their drivers. </p>
