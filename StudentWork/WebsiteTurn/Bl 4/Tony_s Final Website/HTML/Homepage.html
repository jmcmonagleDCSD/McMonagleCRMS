            Snowboarding orginiated in the 1960s and 1970s, evolving from various different winter sports. One of the keys of this 
            early development was Sherman Poppen because he created the so called "Snurfer" in 1965 by attaching two skis together
            and using a rope to help steer him. This invention helped create a new spark of interest for sliding down snow-covered hills.

            In the 1970s, many other innovaters such as Jake Burton Carpenter and Tom Sims began refining the desighn of the Snowboard
            by adding bindings and changing the shapee. Burton, specificly, played a hige role in the promotion of the Snowboard to make it 
            a well known winter activity.
