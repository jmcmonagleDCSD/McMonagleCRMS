            <h1> Freeride</h1>

    

            <p>Freeride snowboards are designed primarily for riding big, steep, variable terrain, including alpine and backcountry. Freeride snowboards typically have directional shapes.</p>
            <p>Freestyle snowboarding is a style of snowboarding that incorporates tricks. Using natural features like snow banks and man-made objects like rails and ramps, freestyle snowboarders use the environment around them to do a wide variety of flips, spins and tricks. Several of the most popular snowboarding events are classified as freestyle snowboarding, like slopestyle or half-pipe contests.</p>
            <p>Freestyle snowboarding can really be performed anywhere on the slopes. If you are going down a trail, the natural dips and bends of the terrain can provide ample opportunity for you to test out your freestyle skills. However, the best place for freestyle snowboarding at any resort is the terrain parks. These locations are created solely for the purpose of freestyle snowboarding. The best terrain parks include a variety of surfaces and structures: jumps and half-pipes for mid-air maneuvers, rails and stairs for a more street-style experience, as well as some natural features.</p>
