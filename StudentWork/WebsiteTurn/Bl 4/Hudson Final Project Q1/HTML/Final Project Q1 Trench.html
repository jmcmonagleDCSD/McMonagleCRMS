<h1>Trench: The album of Lore</h1><br>
<h4>Trench
Tyler is now stranded on the continent of Trench with a burnt car. He pops open the trunk to find a greenish-gray jumpsuit. He puts it on and starts walking in the island in search of the myth of the Bandidos. Now Nico knows Tyler is missing and knows where he is, Nico climbs onto his horse and rides out deep into Trench.
       Tyler is now in some sort of valley with a tiny stream of water going beneath his feet, as he is walking feeling as if he is almost going to die he sees people on top of the mountains. Then Nico rides up on his horse, and walks up to Tyler, Nico's face was rotten and old and he wore a veil over it. As well as a red robe covering the rest of his body.
          Tyler sees the people on the mountains and gains bits of hope, so he runs. He sprints away from Nico, but inevitably falls only for Nico to put his hands on Tyler's neck turning it black and corrupted, as he has done many times. Then Nico takes Tyler away back to Dema, but the people on the mountains wearing similar jumpsuits as Tyler throw yellow flowers down.
          Now Tyler is back in the city of Dema, but the people on the mountain knew there was something that Tyler did to him that would prove a great quality. They organized an operation to get Tyler out of Dema , so they went under the city. They found Tyler and brought him to the Bandito base. The people on the mountain are actually the myths called the Banditos. Even though Tyler escaped, Dema most didn’t, but now they have hope.
    Now that Tyler is learning how to be a Bandito they gave him his jumpsuit and shaved his head. He learns about the Bandito ways as the Torch Bearer, Josh Dun helps him. Although, it does not last for long as he is grabbed on the neck by Nico’s two hands unable to escape. 
    Now Tyler has caused too much trouble , so Nico and the Niners sent him off out of Dema, because they know their  end is coming soon.</h4>
