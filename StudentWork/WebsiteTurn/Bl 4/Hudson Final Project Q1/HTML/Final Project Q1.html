<h2>Track List</h2>
<ol>
<h3><li>Ode To Sleep: This Song was written about Tyler Joseph, and how he suffers from anxiety and depression. As well as singing about his religeous beliefs, as a christan some words revolve around things in the bible. From my understanding.</li><br><br>
<li>Holding On To You: In the song "Holding on to you" talks about how his faith in God is the only thing keeping him alive. The reason for that is because he has suicidal thoughts which makes him vulenrable to many thing.From my understanding.</li><br><br> 
<li>Migrain: In the song Migrain, instead of refering to an actual migrain he expresses that the migrain represents his psychological disorder of anxiety, depresion, and suicidal thoughts.From my understanding.</li><br><br>
<li>House Of Gold: The song House of Gold is a conversation between Tyler and his mother. His mother, Kelly Joseph wonders if Tyler will be there for her when his father, Chris Joseph. Tyler replies that he would drop everything to help her through her rough time.From my understanding.</li><br><br>
<li>Car Radio: The song Car Radio, is about how it is very hard to sit in silence while intrusive thoughts and emotions come at him. Even though this song is very sad, it became the most popular song on Vessel.From my understanding.</li><br><br>
<li>Semi-Automatic: This song Semi-Automatic is about how some of his actions are semi-automaic even if they are the wrong thing, which is something he outright says in the songFrom my understanding.From my understanding.</li><br><br>
<li>Screen: The song Screen is about how Tyler Joseph has a screen on his chest showing raw emotion even if he tries to hide it. Because God can always see through and he can't hide his sinful emotions and thoughts which is tough, but makes him want to be a better man. From my understanding.</li><br><br>
<li>The Run And Go: The amazing song, The Run and go is about how people try to escape or run from their problems, as wellever works. From my understanding.</li><br><br>
<li>Fake You Out: The song Fake you out represents how Tyler feels like he is not true to himself and thinks that he shows himself to people not how he really is in his mind. From my understanding.</li><br><br>
<li>Guns For Hands: The song Guns for Hands is about how bad people have guns and use it for the wrong reasons. It is alos mentioned that  as Tyler, but it nhe stays up at night thinking about how many lives were taken. From my understanding.</li><br><br>
<li>Trees: The popular song Trees shows dialoge from a man who is hiding in the trees and God. The man is scared and silent, and God reaches out first starting the conversation, showing that the man's heart's wish is to be with God. From my understanding.</li><br><br>
<li>Truce: The final song on the album Truce combines the message of Vessel, him fearing the night. Also how no matter what happens God has a plan and even if it doesn't seem right it will all work out in the end. From my understanding.</li><br><br>
