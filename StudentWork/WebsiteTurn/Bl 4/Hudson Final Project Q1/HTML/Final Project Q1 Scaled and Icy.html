    <h4>
        Tyler was now put to work by the bishops to spread propaganda across the world.<br> Tyler worked on a submarine underwater, performing to a large crowd of unsuspecting people.<br> Then a pet of the bishops, Trash.<br> An underwater dragon roaming the sea seized by Keons, one of the Niners. <br>Also known as a bishop. <br>Seizing is an art that the bishops use which means they can control a dead animal, or person.<br> Although, you can see when something is seized their eyes turn yellow.<br> Well, Keons seizing Trash crashed him into the submarine making the entire thing flood.<br> 
        Tyler washed up on an island named Voldsoy and wandered.<br> Now stranded Tyler has no idea what to do now that he escaped from Dema.<br>However he starts seeing something on the island, something moving, almost like it is hiding.<br>Then Tyler finds this cave, and a torch.<br> He starts going in to find dozens of little furry creatures.<br> These things are called Neds, they are little furry antlered creatures that have big black eyes. <br>They are showing Tyler around the cave and there are more and more of them hiding all throughout the cave.<br> Then one of them gives Tyler its antlers.<br> At the same time Keons was killed because he had betrayed the bishops, by using Trash to help Tyler escape.<br> Tyler put the antlers up to his head and the power of the antlers allowed him to seize Keons.<br> He did a dance and destroyed lights in the middle of the sanctum in Dema.
