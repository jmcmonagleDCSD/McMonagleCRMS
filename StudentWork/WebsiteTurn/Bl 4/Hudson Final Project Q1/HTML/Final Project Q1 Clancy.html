<h2>The Return to Trench</h2>
<h4>Now Tyler is ready to go back to Trench, and while he readies his boat to sail to Trench, Josh is getting the Banditos ready. Over the sea Tyler seizes a dead man at a secluded building in Dema. He controls the man and Josh shows these new people they found and the Banditos the plan. This is a huge turn in the story because this is when Tyler changes his name to someone who inspired all these people, before he died. Clancy. Clancy was a man who was the leader of the people and the rival against the bishops, although he was executed. Now Tyler took his name to inspire the people as well, and now he is the leader. Then Clancy arrives on the continent of Trench ready for what comes next.
    Clancy is now Navigating through the forest contemplating what is going on in his own mind and how long it has been since he has been in Trench. Josh also has been going through the forest and they will meet at a spot in the forest. After a long time of traveling they meet each other again after so long, even though Josh has been there the entire time guiding Tyler even though he was not physically there. Josh gives Clancy his mask that was on the man that he seized and now they were almost ready to attack Dema. 
    Clancy is on the edge of a cliff sharpening the antlers given to him by a creature named Ned. Josh and the other Banditos bring him a huge box that was carved very delicately that holds his Clancy suit. They go back to the Bandito camp to prepare themselves to cross the Paladin Strait. Vultures seized by the bishops spy on the Banditos. As the Banditos, Josh, and Tyler approach the city of Dema, the bishops use their real power, something that they had been holding in the neon gravestones. The glorious gone awakes from their death slumber by being seized by the bishops. They are all the people that have died in Dema and have been executed, and have been buried in the neon gravestones. The glorious gone uses the gravestones as lightsabers and attacks the Banditos. The bishops have power unlike others, being able to seize more than one person, making them able to control the zombies/glorious gone. While the Banditos and Josh fight, Clancy sneaks off under the city to get in. He climbs up the towers in the middle of Dema. He jumps through the window to find the bishops standing there. Tyler defeats them with the power of the antlers, only for the chamber door to open and Nico comes out and grabs Tyler’s neck. Then Nico says something in a deep voice, “So few, So proud, So emotional, Hello Clancy.
