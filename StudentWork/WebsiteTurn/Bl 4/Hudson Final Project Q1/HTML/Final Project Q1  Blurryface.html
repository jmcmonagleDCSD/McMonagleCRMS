    <h2>The Start of Dema</h2>
    <p>The song Heavydirtysoul starts it all. Tyler Joseph made a diversion by burning a car escaping the city of Dema and becoming stranded on the continent of Trench.
        Blurryface, also known as Nicholas Bourbaki, is an embodiment of Tyler's fear, stress, anxiety, and intrusive thoughts.
        Nicholas, known as Nico is the leader of the city of Dema, and has a group called Nico and the Niners.
        Not much story is shown from this album, because it is mostly written from the perspective of Nico, given how depressed it is.
        Even though the lyrics are somber in this album it sounds happy which is a contridiction that makes it so good.
        Finally the song Goner is from point of view of Tyler, and how he has no food, nor shelter. Making him close to death, calling out to God in prayer, the album of Blurryface ends.

From my understanding.</li><br><br>
