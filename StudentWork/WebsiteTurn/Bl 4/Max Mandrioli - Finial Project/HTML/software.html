                    I use three diffrent softawares. First of all, Roughanimator. It is so far the best and cheapest animation software that
                    I know of. It is easy to learn and pretty simple, but it still allows you to make some really cool stuff. I also use 
                    Krita. I use krita for general digital drawings. Krita is free and very powerfull. Lastly, I've been learning Adobe Animate.
                    Adobe Animate is on a very proffesional level. Many people in the industry use it. However, I've realized that Adobe is 
                    starting to fall apart.

                    What The "Industry" Uses
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The industry standerd for 2D animation is Adobe products. For 3D animation, it is Maya. But the industry is needing
                    less 2d animators, as well as Adobe products are become less usefull. Some 2D animation brands are switching
                    to Toonbloom Harmony. Toonbloom Harmony is similar to Adobe animate because it has a similar amount of control.
                    However the reason why Toonbloom Harmony is better, is because of the system itself. Tools and fetures apeer
                    finished and are useable. For 3D software, the industry has stuck to Maya for a while. Blender used to be a large
                    competetor for 3D rendering and animation. But it has sense focused on being a free progam.
