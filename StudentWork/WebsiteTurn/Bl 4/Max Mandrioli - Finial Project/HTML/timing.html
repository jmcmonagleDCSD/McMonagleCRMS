                    What Timing is
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Timing is how fast or slow somthing is moving in an animation. A object with very fast timing
                    will move very fast when the animation is played. A car has very fast timing. Timing is 
                    very importaint when animating because it is what humans are acostomed to seeing. We know
                    the timing of how fast or slow people talk. We know the timing of how fast a airliner should 
                    be flying. If a plane in a animation is moving very slow, then the animation will feel
                    unatural.

                <h2>
                    How You Should Apply it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Timing will make you animations feel natural. However this is not the only 
                    thing that will make your animations feel natural. Timing is just one 
                    of the priciples of animation. There a twelve of them. I find that timing
                    is a really impotaint one. It works with many other pricibles, but you cannnot 
                    use most the other pricibles without good timing. <br> Spacing litterly depends
                    on timing. If you make a slow object move fast, then it will be spaced
                    akwardly on the screen. Easing requires that you can make things move fast 
                    and/or slow. Timing is very importaint.

                <p>
                    So how do you accually apply timing? On the basic level:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Less frames further apart = faster timing.</li>
                    <li>More frames closer together = slower timing.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    If I want to make a ball move across the screen very slowly, then
                    I would add many frames of it moving. The more frames, the slower the ball moves.
                    This is all because if you have 24 frames of the ball moving accross the screen,
                    then it will take one second of animation to play those 24 frames. But if you 
                    double that and make 48 frames of the ball, then it will take 2 seconds to move.
                    The opposite also works. Having less frames of the ball moving will make it move 
                    faster because it takes less time to show less frames.
