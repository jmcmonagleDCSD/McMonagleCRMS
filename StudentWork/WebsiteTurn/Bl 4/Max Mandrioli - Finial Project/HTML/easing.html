                    The Idea
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Easing, or also known as slow in and slow out, is changing the timing of an object. 
                    In physics, this is just called acceleration. acceleration can be negitive or positive.
                    You can ease an object in or out. If you have a stationary object, and want to make it move
                    accross the screen very fastly, you would ease it in. It's the trasition between the
                    frames that the object is stationary, and the frames that the object is moving very fast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just like acceration, you can have fast and slow easing. A very fast ease in will have
                    less frames between the stationary frames and the moving frames. Slower easing will mean more
                    frames during the transiton. And as you learned on the timing page, more frames means slower
                    timing. So the object will be very slow at first, then move faster and faster till it reaches
                    it's max velocty. You can also apply the inverse to easing out. A object can be moving 
                    very fast, and then it gets slower, and slower, until it stops.

                <h2>
                    How to Apply it
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You can apply easing to you animations. What's happening when you add 
                    easing to a object, is that you are progressivly changing the timing 
                    of the object. Lets make a stationary ball ease in and out of motion.
                    First, you have to have lots of frames close together. Those frames will
                    progressivly get further and further apart. And once the ball is moving
                    fast across the screen, you can start to ease it out. you make the far
                    apart frames closer together. They get closer, and closer, until the 
                    ball looks like it stoped. Now yoy should have a very smooth motion.
