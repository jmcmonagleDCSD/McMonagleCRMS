      <div class="Baseball-Bats"><h3>History!</h3></div> 
<div class="History"><p>Marucci's bats were the most used in the MLB, with more than <br>40% of players.

  Jack Marucci, LSU Tigers athletic trainer,[3] built his first baseball bat after he 
  unsuccessfully tried <br>to find a 
  suitable one for his son Gino. The bat-making was
   just a hobby until Marucci
   associated with two MLB players,<br> Kurt Ainsworth and Joe Lawrence. Ainsworth began recommending 
  Marucci's bat to other players, and in 2009 he became one of Marucci's co-founders.[4]</p>

  <div class="History2"><p>The Marucci Code -10 is meticulously crafted to empower young sluggers. 
    Its one-piece alloy construction provides a clean, consistent swing feel, perfect for developingproper hitting mechanics.
     The magic truly happens with the multi-variable wall design. This innovative technology 
     expands the sweet spot, thins the barrel walls for a lighter swing weight, and delivers a more forgiving feel on off-center hits.</p>
