<div class="History"><p>Ray DeMarini was one-of-a-kind. At the age of 40, playing on his company softball team 
  quickly turned into a full-blown obsession with the sport. To become a competitive tournament softball player at 5’6” and 185 lbs.,<br> Ray knew he had to train 
  smarter to hold his own amongst other<br> hulking players. His scientific approach to training, 
  a 96 mph batting speed and a bombastic attitude quickly earned<br> him the reputation of a savage competitor among the biggest guys in his league.]</p>
