      <div class="Baseball-Bats"><h3>History!</h3></div> 
<div class="History"><p>In 1894, Bud took over the family business and ‘Louisville Slugger’ was registered with the United States Patent
    <br>Office. Eleven years later in 1905, the company forever changed not just baseball – but sports marketing –<br> by paying future Hall of Famer Honus Wagner to use his name on a bat.
    Before Wagner, no player endorsed a bat nor an athlete endorsed an athletic product. That practice, of course, continues to this day across all ,<br>sports. Since signing that first contract, 
    <br>Louisville Slugger has worked with generations of the best ballplayers in the game, including: Babe Ruth,,<br> Ty Cobb, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Ted Williams, Jackie Robinson, Johnny Bench, Roberto Clemente, Hank Aaron, George Brett, Tony Gwynn, Ken Griffey Jr. and Derek Jeter.
