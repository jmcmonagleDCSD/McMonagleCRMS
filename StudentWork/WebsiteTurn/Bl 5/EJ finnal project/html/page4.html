    <p>Luffy is usually recognizable by his straw hat, a gift from "Red-Haired" Shanks. In his early childhood, he wears a white shirt and blue shorts.
     The character has a scar under his left eye from stabbing himself to demonstrate his courage to Shanks and his crew.</p>
     <p>Luffy's superpower is his ability to stretch his limbs â€” and we're not talking about yoga. Made of rubber, his arms and legs give him an advantage in any fight. 
    Whether he's kicking through brick buildings or propelling himself into his opponents like a slingshot, you don't want to be on his bad side.</p>
    <p>Luffy: All kinds of Meat. Roronoa Zoro: White rice, sea king meat, and anything that complements ale. Nami: Mainly tangerines as well as other 
        kinds of fruit. Usopp: Pike from an autumn island as well as other fish of the season, hates mushrooms.</p>
        <p>Luffy's straw hat is the main symbol of the entire series and is the origin of his nickname "Straw Hat Luffy." His straw hat was given to him by his idol,
             "Red-Haired" Shanks when Luffy was a child, and he promised to give the hat back to Shanks once he becomes a great pirate (or in other words, the Pirate King)</p>
             <p>Luffy approaches situations with a calm and carefree attitude, almost never taking things seriously. In spite of being captain, Luffy does not take his duties very 
                seriously, and is rarely seen being harsh or enforcing standards on his crew.</p>
