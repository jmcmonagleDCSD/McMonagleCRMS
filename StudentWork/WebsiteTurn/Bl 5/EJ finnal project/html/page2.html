<p>One Piece is adapted from author Eiichiro Oda's award-winning manga
    The anime was inspired by Dragon Ball Z.
    One Piece is one of the longest-running and most popular manga series in history.
    The Straw Hats are the main characters of the story</p>

<p>It started as two one-shot stories entitled Romance Dawnâ€”which would later be used as the title for One Piece's first chapter 
 and volume. They both featured the character of Luffy, and included elements that would appear later in the main series.</p>
 <p>Overall, One Piece certainly has its slow moments, and some might argue the countless flashbacks are painstaking to sit through. However, it is this rich tapestry of context and interwoven connections,
 together with Oda's strong grasp on his characters that takes the series' high moments even higher</p>
 <p>That said, it's never too late to start watching a series as extensive as One Piece, especially since it contains numerous worthwhile arcs</p>
