<h1>one piece beginging story</h1>
<p>what started it was thease words "Narrator: Wealth, fame, power. Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates, attained everything
 this world has to offer. And so, many men head for the Grand Line to find the great treasure he left behind, the One Piece. The world has truly entered a Great Pirate Era!"</p>
<p>The main character of the series, Monkey D. Luffy, is introduced as a child, with his role model, Shanks. After Shanks comes into conflict with Higuma, the 
mountain bandit, at a bar, it is revealed that Luffy accidentally ate a Devil Fruit: the Gomu Gomu no Mi.</p>
<p>ONE PIECE is a legendary high-seas quest unlike any other. Luffy is a young adventurer who has longed for a life of freedom ever since he can remember.
 He sets off from his small village on a perilous journey to find the legendary fabled treasure, ONE PIECE, to become King of the Pirates!</p>
<p>As there are over 1,000 episodes to watch, you might be tempted to jump in at a later starting point, 
but to really enjoy the full experience properly, we do recommend starting at the very beginning and watching One Piece in chronological order.</p>
<p>"We Are!" is a song by Hiroshi Kitadani, composed by Kohei Tanaka with lyrics by Shoko Fujibayashi. 
It was used as the first opening theme for the One Piece television anime, accompanying most of the episodes comprising the East Blue Saga.</p>
<p>and finnaly the most famouse saying in the show is 1 “I Am Going To Be The Pirate King.”</p>
