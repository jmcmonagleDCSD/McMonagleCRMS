        <h2>facts list</h2>
        <p>Luffy is usually recognizable by his straw hat, a gift from "Red-Haired" Shanks. In his early childhood, he wears a white shirt and blue shorts.
             The character has a scar under his left eye from stabbing himself to demonstrate his courage to Shanks and his crew.</p>
             <p>Luffy's superpower is his ability to stretch his limbs â€” and we're not talking about yoga. Made of rubber, his arms and legs give him an advantage in any fight.
                 Whether he's kicking through brick buildings or propelling himself into his opponents like a slingshot, you don't want to be on his bad side.</p>
                 <p>For Luffy to be able to match Naruto's power, it would take at least 10-15 Gears to get him to a level that's competitive enough for a close fight.
                    As the manga and anime series stand, fans don't know if Luffy will ever see that many Gears during his journey, making a Naruto defeat a distant pipedream/AGREE YOU ARE WRONG CHECK MY channel</p>
                    <p>Luffy's straw hat is the main symbol of the entire series and is the origin of his nickname "Straw Hat Luffy." His straw hat was given to him by his idol, "Red-Haired" Shanks when Luffy was a child,
                         and he promised to give the hat back to Shanks once he becomes a great pirate (or in other words, the Pirate King).</p>
