        <P>Luffy is usually recognizable by his straw hat, a gift from "Red-Haired" Shanks. In his early childhood, he wears a white shirt and blue shorts.
             The character has a scar under his left eye from stabbing himself to demonstrate his courage to Shanks and his crew</P>
         <p>Luffy's superpower is his ability to stretch his limbs â€” and we're not talking about yoga. Made of rubber, his arms and legs give him an advantage in any fight. 
                Whether he's kicking through brick buildings or propelling himself into his opponents like a slingshot, you don't want to be on his bad side.</p>
        <p>Uta is a childhood friend, not canon the story, but is a Canon character. Luffy had only met Uta in the non Canon movie, Red, and have shown no romantic feelings for each other.
                     Luffy doesn't never have a girlfriend or wife cause he doesn't really need it. He's asexual, So he has no interest in romance.</p>
     <p>Throughout the series, Luffy gathers himself a diverse crew named the Straw Hat Pirates, including: the three-sword-wielding combatant Roronoa Zoro (sometimes referred to as Roronoa Zolo in the English manga); the thief and navigator Nami;
                         the cowardly marksman and inventor Usopp; the amorous cook and martial artist</p>
        <p>The Straw Hat Pirates have varying levels of cleanliness, with Luffy and Zoro only taking baths once a week, while Sanji, Robin, and Nami take baths every day.</p>
     <p>The Straw Hats are made up of people who have dominated Luffy's adult life and were all recruited personally by him. They have all developed a deep bond with each other and it is fair to say that Luffy
                             values no one more than his Straw Hat crew members, seeing them less as his crew and more as his family.</p>
            <p>Big Mom regains Zeus. On the day of the Fire Festival, Zeus joined the Straw Hats on the Thousand Sunny as they entered the battle with the Beasts Pirates. When he was near Prometheus at Onigashima, 
                                it caused Nami's staff to react. As Prometheus called Big Mom, Zeus fled with Nami and her group.</p>
         <P>Straw hats (made of natural fibers) should NEVER be worn in the rain. A straw hat will not maintain it's shape in wet weather. If you do get caught without an umbrella, once you get indoors always snap your brim up. Next,
                                     try to find somewhere to hang your hat so that the sides of the brim are not touching anything.</P>
