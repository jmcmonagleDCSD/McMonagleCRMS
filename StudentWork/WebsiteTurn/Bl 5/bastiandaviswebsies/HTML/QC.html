    <div class="QC"><p>the quantum computer is a computer that works by seeing the 1 and 0 at the same time a norble computerworks by going 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0, and a quantum computer works by going 10 10 10 10 10 10. Witch on is faster going 1 0 1 0 or 10 10. g\Going 10 10 is fater that is how the quantum computer works by seeing the 1 and 0 ant the smae time</p></div>

    <h1>More on how it works</h1>
    <div class="QCM"><p>The quantum computer works by taking qubits the more qubit the faster the quantum compuer is. The one you are looking at has 20 qubits there has to be more then one and an even number or it will not be a quantum compuer. The compuer runs so hot they need to run liquid nitrogen under it to keep it cool but it stills dose not keep it cool so they can onyl run it for 10 minutes before it over heats. The qubits in the quantum compter go througe a phomenon called quantum entanglemrnt this is where the paeticles can be separted by an distance and they will still worlk to getter.</p><img src="../images/download (7).jpeg" alt="quantum computer"><p>image by Ragsxl form commons.wikimedia.org</p></div>
