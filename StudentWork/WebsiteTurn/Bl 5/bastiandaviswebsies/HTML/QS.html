        <div class="QS"><p>when something is in a state of Quantum superposition it is in a state of being between two or more choice, iike you choiceing to read thin. Before you picked to read thing you where in a state of Quantum superposition of reading it or not. Imgaimng when you make a choice you are on a bringe and there are a infinent number of you, you go one way half of them fallow you and then the other half go the other way whem you are on the side the bringe breacks and there is no going back. Before you say what if you change you mide a go the other way the bring only breack whne you make you finle choice. Like you have a choice between two shirts a red and blue and you pick you pick the blue one if you don't change you mind the bringe will breack if you do half of evey one on the blue side will chainge there mide two and half of the red ones will change there mide two.</p><p>On this image there are two kids one is going left one is going right. Image there where a amont infinite number of them half of them will fallow the kid in blue and the other in yellow.</p></div>
