        <title>Cheaters</title>
     <h1>Cheaters</h1>
    <h2>Astros</h2>
     <p>Are the Houston Astros trying to cheat their way out of the AL West cellar? Moments like Tuesday night at Minute Maid Park won't help their case.

        Right-handed pitcher Ronel Blanco was ejected prior to the start of the fourth inning in a 2-1 win over the Oakland Athletics after umpires found a sticky substance inside his glove. Blanco was slapped with a 10-game suspension by MLB on Wednesday, thus hindering Houston's rotation, which currently ranks 27th in ERA at 4.78.
        
        Blanco, one of baseball's breakout stars in 2024, left the dugout and met with first-base umpire Erich Bacchus, who performed a standard check of his glove. After further review, Bacchus called over the three other umpires for further inspection.
        
        Crew chief and third-base umpire Laz Diaz determined the substance was ineligible for use, thus leading to the ejection. Through three innings, Blanco had been near-perfect, allowing four hits and a walk while striking out four A's. 
        
        Blanco's glove was confiscated by Bacchus, who ran off the field with it and took it for further review. Following the game, Diaz said the glove would be sent to the league office for the commissioner's office to determine the actual substance. 
        
        Said Bassball illastrated. Js proving that the Astros have been cheating. IN 2017 the cheated there way to winning the world seires by banging on a trash can to tell there players what pitch is coming so the can know whats coming and this was seen many time for example when jose altuve  hit a walk off homer to send them to the world seires and when he was coming home he said dont take off my shirt and after the game his teammate didnt take his buzzer off.</p>

        <p>Almost all teams have cheated from the Braves to the Nationals. Most teams have cheated showing that cheating is part of the game but all teams have cheated at different times and years from starodys to sign stealing  </p>
