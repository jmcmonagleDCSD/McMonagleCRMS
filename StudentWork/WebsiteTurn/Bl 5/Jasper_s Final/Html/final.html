        </p><p>Photos from the MLB</p><p>these are the most liked and hated teams in the mlb because of what the do and because of there fan base for example the yankees fan base is something else they can be vary violent and say somethings they shouldnt say or do but have one of the biggest fan base in all of baseball. The Astros are one of the most hated teams in baseball because of what they did to win the league by cheating which made lots of baseball fans hate them because they stole the world seires from the Yankees 
        and Dodgers. The NL and the AL acted as independent organizations from their founding in the 19th century. The two leagues engaged in what was known as the “baseball war” in the years prior to the merger, as the Midwest-based AL moved its teams into the established NL domain of the East Coast and wooed away star players from NL squads. The leagues established a truce in 1903 that resulted in the creation of the World Series, which matched the annual winners of each league to determine a national champion, as well as the National Commission, a three-man governing body that oversaw Major League Baseball but was replaced by a single commissioner of baseball in 1921.</p>
