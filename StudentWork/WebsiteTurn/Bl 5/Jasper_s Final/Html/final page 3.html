<p>The World Series, a championship series in Major League Baseball (MLB), has a rich history that dates back to 1903, when the Boston Americans (now the Red Sox) faced off against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Initially conceived as a way to determine the best team in professional baseball, it has evolved into one of the most celebrated sporting events in the United States. Over the decades, the Series has showcased legendary players and unforgettable moments, from Babe Ruth's heroics in the 1910s to the dramatic Game 7s of more recent years. The Series has expanded its reach, featuring teams from both the American League and National League, and remains a focal point of American culture, drawing millions of viewers and embodying the spirit of competition and sportsmanship.</p>
