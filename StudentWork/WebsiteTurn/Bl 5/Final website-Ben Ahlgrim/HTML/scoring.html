        <p class="on">there is one way you can get a "on" score which is when you are on a par 4 hole and you finish it in 4 this is called a par if you get a par on every hole on the course it is often called breaking even</p>

        <p class="lower">There are three lower scores (albatross, eagle, and birdie) This is your score on a hole if you get less than par Albatross is 3 less than par (getting a hole in one on a par 4) Eagle is getting 2 less than par (2 on a par 4) and a birdie is one less than par</p>

        <p class="higher">when you get higher than par it is often called a bogey, double bogey, and triple bogey one over par is bogey and so on</p>
