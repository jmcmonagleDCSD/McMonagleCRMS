        <h2>some important variables</h2>

        <div class="johny">
            <ul>
                <h3>variables</h3>
                <li>wind</li>
                <li>rain</li>
                <li>clubhead speed</li>
                <li>clubhead face</li>
                <li>balance</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="joey">
            <h4>wind</h4>
            <p>wind can be a major problem when playing golf, for example if you are golfing but there is wind and you try to hit it straight the ball might fly right.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="jamo">
            <h4>rain</h4>
            <p>rain can affect the way you play golf because it weighs the ball down so it can't go as far and more commonly will stop you from making clean contact with the ball and your club face will slip.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="club_hits">depending on how you swing or the speed and finally the rotation the club puts on the ball.</div>

      

        <img class="club_direction" src="../images/club_direction.jpeg" alt="club direction">

        <div class="direction"> based off of the club direction it hits the balls but each club should be facing differently based on the angle of the clubhead</div>

        <img class="speed" src="../images/carry_distance.jpg" alt="carry distance chart">

        <div class="carry">every mile per hour gained in clubhead speed results in the ball traveling 2.3 yards further. An increase of 5 mph will result in an increase of 11+ yards of distance. On the golf course, that's a significant difference.</div>

        <div class="spin">3</div>
