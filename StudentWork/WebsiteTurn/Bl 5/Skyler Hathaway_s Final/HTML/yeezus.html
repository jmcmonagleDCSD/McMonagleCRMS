<h2>Important Songs</h2>
<h4>On Sight</h4>
<p>This is a very weird into but good. People were expecting happy kanye with this album that they were used to but instead the album started with a very screechy beat and Kanye funnily shows a tiny bit of what people wanted but then goes back to the other thing.</p>
<h4>Bound 2</h4>
<p>This song is what people expected out of the album it is the typical kanye beat and song many fans of what the album was didn't like this song but I like the album and this song even though their different.</p>
<h4>Blood on the Leaves</h4>
<p>This song has a very good beat and talks about a relationship that went wrong.</p>
