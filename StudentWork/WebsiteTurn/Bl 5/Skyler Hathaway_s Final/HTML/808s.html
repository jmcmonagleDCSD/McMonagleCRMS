<h2>Important Songs</h2>
<h4>Pinochio Story</h4>
<p>This song is pelciluar, it is a live preformance but there is no studio version of this song it is only live. This song uses Pinochios story as an anolgy of Kanye's life on how he wants to be a "real boy".</p>

<h2>Worst Song</h2>
<h4>Welcome To Heartbreak</h4>
<p>This song isn't terrible but it's the only song on the album I would consider bad. This is because it is very slow and even boring pace wise and not very entertaining.</p>
