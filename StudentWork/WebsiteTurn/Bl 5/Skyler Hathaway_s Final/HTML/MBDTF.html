<h2> Important Songs</h2>
<h4>Runaway</h4>
<p> This is Kanye's best song not my favorite song but it's his best. It is an amazing song that goes into why Kanye is what Kanye is and also features and amazing verse from Pusha T. I could go very in-depth on this song but I'll just leave it there</p>
<h4>All of the Lights</h4>
<p> This 1st Kanye song I ever heard and one of his most popular. He raps incredibly on this album and Rihaana's chorus is amazing here. He also get's Drake on this song not to have a verse but for backround vocals just at the end of the song</p>
<h4>Dark Fantasy</h4>
<p>This is Kanye's best intro from any album. It has an amazing sample and great lyrics and set's the tone of this album very, very well</p>

<h2>Worst Song</h2>
<h4>So Appalled</h4>
<p>This song is the only bad one on the album and when I say it's bad its bad. It is a very slow song and the beat is also really bad the song runs too long and the features don't add anything of substance to the album.</p>

<div class="mbquotes">

    <p>"I just needed time alone
    <br>
    With my own thoughts
    <br>
    Got treasures in my mind
    <br>
    but couldn't open up my own vault
    <br>
    My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
    <br>
    Is honeslty being crowded by these grown thoughts
    <br>
    Reality is catching up with me 
    <br> 
    Taking my inner child
    <br>
    I'm fighting for custody"
    <br><br>

<div class="mbq">
<p>
"Never was much of a romantic 
<br>
I could never take the intimacy
<br>
And I know it did damage
<br>
'Cause the look in your eyes is killin' me 
<br>
I guess then you at advantage 
<br>
'Cause you could blame me for everything"
<br><br>
