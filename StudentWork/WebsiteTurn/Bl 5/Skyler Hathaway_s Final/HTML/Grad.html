<h2>Important Songs</h2>
<h4>Homecoming</h4>
<p>This is my personal favoirte Kanye song. It talks about Kanyes home city Chicago and how he grew up their and how important it is to him. It also details the impact he had on kids their them wanting to be like him. Very nice piano beat.</p>

<h4>Big Brother</h4>
<p>This song details Kanye's metaphorical big brother, Jay-Z, Ye talks about how much he inspired him. Giving his first record deal and helping him along the way becoming very close throughout. He also talks about how he has the drive to become the best but for that he'll need to beat his brother. </p>

<h4>Everything I Am</h4>
<p>In this song Kanye talks about all his flaws and how that even though their bad it makes him him so he still apreciate them.</p>

<h2>Worst Song</h2>
<h4>Drunk & Hot Girls</h4>
<p>This is the first very bad song that we've had so far and theirs not a lot of them throughout the older tracks. It just doesn't match the vibe of the album and probaly shouldn't be on it. On top of that it just isn't a good song.</p>
