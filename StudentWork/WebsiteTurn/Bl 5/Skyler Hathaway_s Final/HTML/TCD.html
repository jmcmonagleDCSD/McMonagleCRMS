<h2>Important Songs</h2>

<h4>Through The Wire</h4>

<p>This Song took place after Kanye had a life threataning car accident that left his mouth wired shut. People said Kanye would never rap again and then he rapped this song with his mouth still wired shut, setting up the rest of his hip hop career.</p>

<h4>All Falls Down</h4>

<p>This song delves into being self-consious and was origanaly named that. This is one of the 1st introspective rap songs. it tells the story of a girl thats in college for a major that she doesn't care for or make her any money but can't dropout because it is against the status quoe. It also delves into Kanye self-consiousness and how he buys expensive things to make himself feel better about himself.</p>

<h4>Family Buisness</h4>

<p> This song has a nostalgic feel to it. It talks about how family is very important but even with the conflict it doesn't matter because its still your family and you love them. </p>
