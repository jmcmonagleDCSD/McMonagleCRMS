<h1> Early Kanye West
</h1>
<p>Kanye West is one of the most talented and influential artist of our genoration. He is also my favorite artist. In this website wesite we will go over Kanye West's first 6 solo studio albums, The College Dropout, Late Registration, Graduation, 808's & Heartbreak, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, and Yeezus. It is undeinable that Kanye's music quality has declined since then espacilly in recent years well he still makes good songs they are not to the quality of those former. This website will also ONLY be about his MUSIC not ANYTHING else.</p>
