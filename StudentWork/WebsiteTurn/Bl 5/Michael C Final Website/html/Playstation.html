The only reason Mr. Kutaragi created the PlayStation was because he noticed that his daughter was playing a Famicom and realized how much potential he had if he were to create a video game console, thus the PlayStation was born.<br>You may be wondering why PlayStaion is speical compared to other question?

            <h2>What is the most RECENT console?</h2>
            <hr><hr>
            <p>The most recent console to this date is PlayStation 5. You could argue that the Playstation 5 PRO is but it has yet to come out so I believe it isn't allowed to be the most recent. Besides the point why is the PlayStaion 5 worth buying? Playstaion is all next Gen, going next level with their technology. From is sleek and crisp design to the 4K graphics, its about everything next Gen SCREAMS! </p>
