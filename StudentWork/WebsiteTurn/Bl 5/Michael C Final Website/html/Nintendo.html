        <p>Nintendo, arguable the BIGGEST company out of all of Playstation and Xbox, but does that make it good? Well to start off nintendo has the most original titles compared to both Xbox and Nintendo. Ranging from Super Mario Bros, being the face of Nintendo, to Pokemon. Nintendo is the most creative with their consoles, most notably, THE WII. This console used all motion controls, it was almost like a TV remote but you had to point the controller at a sensor bar for it to recognize the controller.<br>Another reason on why the WII was its best console was because it came with a free copy of, WII sports.</p>
        <hr><hr>
        <p>Alright so what the WII is cool but what about the Nintendo Switch? The motion controllers didn't go away with the switch but what did go away was the sensor bar. The switch is very unqiue with their controllers and they can detach from the actual console.<br>The Switch also has 3 different versions, the original one, the switch LITE, and the switch OLED.</p>

            <h2>Why is SNES the best? (Super Nintendo)</h2>
            <hr><hr>
            <p>Some systems may have been more innovative compared to the SNES but lets not forget the WONDERS of the SNES. The SNES has a beautiful catalog of games that reached the top and/or peak of gaming for the industry. This amazing line up games included The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Super Mario World, Super Metroid, and Final Fantasy VI. These games pushed the gaming industry to where it is today. So thank the SNES for the games we got today.</p>
