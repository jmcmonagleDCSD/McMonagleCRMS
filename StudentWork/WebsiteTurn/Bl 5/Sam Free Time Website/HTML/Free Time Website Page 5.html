    <div><h1>Spirits</h1></div>
    <div class="Par-5"><p>Spirits is where you fight like you would in Brawl but you can use these ghost-like beings called spirits which are used for upgrading your Strongness, Defense, Skill and it can also be neutral.</p></div>
    <div><h2>Strongness Spirits</h2></div>
    <div class="Par-5"><p>Strongness Spirits are useful when you're fighting a Skill sprit, but when fighting a Defense sprit you would have more of a chance of losing then winning. Strongness spirits can be usful when fighting. They will make your attack power go up. Then your hits will be harder and stronger.Being strong can help you hit harder of but you can fight without sprits if you want to because it can be more challenging and more fun and more tricky. If you win a fight with a Strongness Sprit it will get stronger as well until it's level 100 and it reaches its full power and will transform into a bigger stronger spirit that looks more strong and fiece.</p></div>
    <div><h2>Defense Spirits</h2></div>
    <div class="Par-5"><p>Defense Spirits can beat Strongness Spirits but are weak to Skill Spirits. They can summon shields that can absorb most of the attack. The are useless for offense but useful for defense. They can be really good for you when you activate defense mode it is where you become metal and can't get hurt for 1 minute per every third battle. It can be useful if you are scared and want to be unhittable for a time. If i had a chance to do that I would because it would be a good time to attack the other fighter and not being afraid of getting beaten. If you didn't do that at least once then you would be a show-off. Don't try to impress a girl in this game you might beat who you're trying to impress.</p></div>
    <div><h2>Skill Spirits</h2></div>
    <div class="Par-5"><p>Skill Spirits will make you faster and there's a 25% chance that a messange will appear above you and warn you about the other fighter's attack. This can be useful when you don't know what the other fighter's going to do. If I could do that all of the time I would do it because it is super OP. If you were super bad then became super OP then you would really good at the game but not better then me because I would be the master at this game because I created it and you shall never beat me in this game. This reminds me in Master Mode There is a best fighter ever tournament and it chooses who is the best fighter in the whole game. I would be at the top because I made this game I would know every move a fighter could make so I would be at the top most of the time and beat most challengers.</p></div>
    <div><h2>Neutral Spirits</h2></div>
    <div class="Par-5"><p>Neutral Spirits are not better or worse they are in the middle. They are for people who wants nobody to be stronger or weaker and wants to be at a equal level. If I used a Neutral spirit then I would be at the same level as the other person. Then it would be a fair fight and we would have the same chance of winning. This type of spirit is mainly for people new at this game mode. With this type of spirit you could cancel the boost the other fighter gets so that can be very useful. So use this if the other fighter is more powerful. I would use this because it could help the other fighter be weaker it's a 5% chance of making the other fighter weaker.</p></div>
    <div><h2>Spirit Evolution</h2></div>
    <div class="Par-5"><p>Spirit Evolution is where a spirit gets to level 100 and evolves into their full power. For example the kitty pirate spirit would go from cute and cuttley to ruthless and bloodthirsty. When a spirit evolves its bonus powers will become stronger. If the kitty pirate spirit evolves its +50 strongness will become a +75 bonus. This happens because the spirit has been pushing itself to its max power. It will stop ungrading and stay at its level. I would train my spirits and get them super stong so they will give me better bonuses in fights. I would do the spirit trail that's where you and one spirit goes on a short adventure and makes the spirit have a better chance of the bonuses happening.</p></div>
