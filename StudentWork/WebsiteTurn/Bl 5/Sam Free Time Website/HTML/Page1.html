        <Div><h1>Fighting Freaks</h1></Div>
        <div class="Par-1"><p>  Fighting Freaks is a fighting game made by me Samuel Murray that is able to be bought on this website. He started out in a class in Castle Rock Middle School, called Exporing Computer Science which has a great teacher called McMonagle. He taught Sam and helped him make this fun game.</p></div>

        <button type="button" onclick="alert('The maker is a smart, brave, and kind young man! Sam is very resourceful. He can be very helpful, kind, nice, and a bit of a sore loser. He also had some noisy neighbors in the other side of the computer lab')">Click Me to learn about the maker!</button>
        <Div><h2>Types Of Modes</h2></Div>
        <div class="Par-1"><p>  Fighting Freaks is an online fighting game. It has many different freaks that are fighting each other for their right to be normal. There are 5 ways to play.</p></div><div class="Par-1"><ol>   
            <li>Brawl</li>
            <li>Tournament</li>
            <li>Squad Fight</li>
            <li>Spirits</li>
            <li>Master Mode</li>
        </ol></div>
        <div class="Par-1"><p>  All of these modes make this game amazing. Without them you would be bored to death before you started. That is why these game modes were created. All together they make the fun game game you know now.</p></div>

        <div><h2>Hoilday Packs</h2></div>
        <div class="Par-1"><p>  Every hoilday there is a special freak pack where you can earn them after you earn enough freak tokens. Like the halloween pack where there's Pumpkin Puker who pukes pumpkin pulp land mines that he can't activate, Vampwolf who can turn into a flying bat and a lumberjack with a strong punch, and Mumghost who can wrap you in bandages and go though a super attack once in a week, and etc.</p><p>   There's also the Christmas pack. With Snow Goon who gets bigger with packing snow on himself and can make snow minions who are smaller and weaker, Santy Claws who has sharp claws that slash and can summon elfs, and Toy Beast a living beast made out of toy and can summon toy minions that make him smaller, and etc.</p><p> The Easter pack has Bun Bun a creepy bunny that throws color egg bombs, Basket Mouth a Easter basket with arms and legs and can eat the egg bombs without harm and can spit them back out, but has a weak punch, and etc.</p><p>The School Pack(That is always here during the school year) where there's Prof. Pencil who can draw three things in battle per day, Backpack Yaker who yaks up lunch box land mines, and etc.</p><p>These packs help players who can't beat characters you can't beat by letting them play as the new character then challenge the old character again.</p></div>
        
        <Div><h2>Freak Tokens</h2></Div>
        <div class="Par-1"><p>  Freak Tokens are what you earn for winning a battle, and you get a certain amount for each battle you win. Like say you win on your last life, you would win 1-10 tokens. But if you won with half of your lifes you would win 11-20 tokens. But if you won with all of your lifes, you'd win 21-35 tokens. It doesn't just depend on how much lives you have it's also depeneds on how good you fight. If you fight with your least might possible you'll get 1-5 tokens, if you fight with half of your might you'll get 6-10 tokens, and if you fight with all your might you'll get 11-15 tokens. Depanding on how you fight and how good you fight and how you defend you'll get a bonus of 1-20 Freak Tokens.</p></div>
        
        <Div><h2>Super Attacks</h2></Div>
        <div class="Par-1"><p>  Super Attacks are different for every character. I have menioned them in the hoilday packs section, but didn't explain them. Super Attacks are a character's most powerful move. They can be used when a freak charges the right amount of energy to release a super attack. For example the super attack for Vampwolf he turns into a bat and bites you and then turns into the lumberjack and punches you offscreen.</p></div>
