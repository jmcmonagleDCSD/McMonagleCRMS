        <div><h1>Brawl</h1></div>
        <div class="Par-2"><p>Brawl is were you can make a public or private server or join a public or private server to fight together online. This helps players connect to each other and fight together. There are 5 modes of Brawl.</p></div>
        <div class="Par-2"><ol>
        <li>Solo vs Com</li>
        <li>Solo vs Solo</li>
        <li>Team vs Team</li>
        <li>Team vs Solo</li>
        <li>Multifighter Mode</li>
        </ol></div><div class="Par-2"><p>These are the gamemodes you can fight with. They help you have fun in this amazing game. If you or the person your fighting with wins theres a 20% chance a new character will show up and challenge the winner, this works in Solo vs Com(If you win), Solo vs Solo, Team vs Team(Who gets the most KOs wins), Team vs Solo(If the solo wins or the guy with the most KOs on the team wins), and Multifighter Mode(Whoever wins). There are tons of different maps to fight on. Like the haunted pumpkin patch map it turns to night and day it starts as day and not haunted then goes to night and there are ghosts.</p></div>
        <div><h2>Solo vs Com</h2></div>
        <div class="Par-2"><p>Solo vs Com is where you fight the computer who will be either a random or certian freak depending on what you chose. You can chose who the computer is going to be or make it a random character you have earned or bought. Then you can change how hard or easy the com fights. This can be used to give yourself a challenge by putting it at max or you can use it to start small by putting it on min.</p></div>
        <div><h2>Solo vs Solo</h2></div>
        <div class="Par-2"><p>Solo vs Solo is where a fighter fights one other fighter. There can be times where you can find a spot to hide and ambush the other player, but it will not be easy because the your map vision will shrink and grow depending on where the other player is. This can help and hurt in case you don't know where the other person is. Use this to help yourself and hurt the other player just make your choices wisely to beat the other player.</p></div>
        <div><h2>Team vs Team</h2></div>
        <div class="Par-2"><p>Team vs Team is where everybody choses which team their're going to be on and how much people are on each team depending on the players choices. Then you can fight in an all out brawl where you can only attack the other teams players. With teams you can work on your team building skills and work together.</p></div>
        <div><h2>Team vs Solo</h2></div>
        <div class="Par-2"><p>Team vs Solo can be used for players who want a challenge and player who like to work in numbers. SOLO If your the solo then read this part if your the part the the team read the other part. If you're solo you must be very good. If your trying to beat a entire team on your own then you should focus on one at a time then you can work your way to the others, but if you want a challenge then focus on three at a time, and if your inbetween do two at a time. These strategys can work on solo. TEAM If your the team then read this part if your the solo read the other part. If you're team you must work better in numbers. If your on team head for the solo it should be easy, but be warned if their solo they could be very good so be carful.</p></div>
        <div><h2>Multifighter Mode</h2></div>
        <div class="Par-2"><p>Multifighter Mode is where there are no teams, it's like every freak for themsleves. This is also like chaos mode because it is really hard to tell who's who it's really likely on a small map so if your doing 5-8 players then you should do a big map in case you lose yourself. Multifighter Mode is in my opinion the best mode because there everybody is on equal ground.</p></div>
