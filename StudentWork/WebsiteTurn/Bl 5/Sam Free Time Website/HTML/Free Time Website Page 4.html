    <div><h1>Squad Fight</h1></div>
    <div class="Par-4"><p>Squad Fight is where the first two people fight then the winner of that round will face the other teams second fighter, and it repeats like that till you get depeat the other teams final fighter. It seems easy but it can be very hard if you don't know much about this game. That is why I made this website to help people get better by showing them how it's done. I'm going to install multiple videos about Fighting Freaks so that you can get better, but you can always do it on your own if you want. In my game I want people to have fun so don't stress out too much.</p></div>
    <div><h2>Why I Made Fighting Freaks</h2></div>
    <div class="Par-4"><p>At first I wanted to make a video game but when I found out I would be able to make Fighting Freaks I was so excited. I had to wait an entire middle school quarter to make it but it was worth it. During that time I made this website so I'd know what to add into the game and what to add later into my website.</p></div>
    <div><h2>How I Made My Website</h2></div>
    <div class="Par-4"><p>I started by making the home page it had no pictures or words it was blank and bland. Then I added A title and a little blurb about who made it and who helped me make it. Then I added a subtitle and what the modes were. I added another subtitle and what it was about, I added a lot of imformation and details to each of the characters shown in the hoilday packs. Then I added a subtitle and imformation about Freak tokens. Then I added a subtitle and some imformation about Super attacks. That was the end of Page 1. Then I made Page 2 by first said what is brawl and what gamemodes you can do. Then I added a subtitle and a paragraph on Solo vs Com, then a paragraph about Solo vs Solo, Team vs Team, Team vs Solo, and Multifighter Mode. Then I made custom pictures about the pages then installed them to the pages. Then I started to work on page 3 I made a section on Unlocking Powers, then a section on Fighting, then a section on Earning Different Freaks, then a section on Freak Making, then I made a section on Having Fun, finally I made a section on rules and that was the end of Page 3. Then I started working on Page 4 I made a section about Squad Fight, then one on Why I Made Fighting Freaks, then I made this section on How I Made The Fighting Freaks Website. I worked on Page 5, Then Page 6.</p></div>
    <div><h2>Maps</h2></div>
    <div class="Par-4"><p>Maps can be good or bad depending on how you use them. If you used a small map with a lot of players that can be bad.But if you used a big map with a few(3 and under) that would be good. Maps should be used carfully in case you what to use a big or small map so make good choices when choosing a map. Also you could make your own map with map maker  but be carful if you use lava and ice in a map it can get pretty crazy.</p></div>
    <div><h2>Ways You Get Kicked</h2></div>
    <div class="Par-4"><p>These are the ways you could get kicked.</p>
    <ol><li>Trickery</li>
        <li>Mockery</li>
        <li>Teasing</li>
        <li>Sending Hurtful Chats</li>
        <li>Saying/Chating Cuss words</li>
    </ol><p>These things could get you kicked for 1-20 days so don't do them if you like this game.</p></div>
