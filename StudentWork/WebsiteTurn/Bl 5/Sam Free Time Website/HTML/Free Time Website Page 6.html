    <div><h1>Master Mode</h1></div>
    <div class="Par-6"><p>Master Mode is where you can only play if you complete the other modes. If you complete master mode then you can get in the Tournament Of The Masters and if you complete it and win it then you will be the Freak Master and you get to keep that title if you win so you could just say."I entered and I won I have nothing else to prove."</p></div>
    <div><h2>Rewards</h2></div>
    <div class="Par-6"><p>If you win The Tournament Of The Masters you will get 25 moves(Only once), 10,000 Freak Tokens, and the title of Freak Master(Also only once). These rewards does not mean the game is over it means you are a master at the game. I would keep playing even if I completed the game I would keep playing because it is fun and exciting. Keep playing even if you've completed the game play anyway. I would still be the champion.</p></div>
