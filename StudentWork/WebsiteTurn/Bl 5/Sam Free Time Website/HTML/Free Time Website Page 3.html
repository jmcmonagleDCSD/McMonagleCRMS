        <div><h1>Tournament</h1></div>
        <div class="Par-3">
        <p>Tournament is where you can have 2-16 players/com fight each other in a one vs one, two vs two, three vs three, and four vs four. These battles can help you train and get better at the game. For example I could put all other players com and make their levels 1 that can help you train and unlock more moves.</p></div>
        <div><h2>Unlocking Powers</h2></div>    
        <div class="Par-3">
        <p>Every time you win a tournament you get a 20% chance that you will get a locked move. Each character has 50 locked moves 80 in total because of the 5 you start with like basic punch, you also can only equip 5. You can only unlock 5 moves using Brawl, you can unlock 10 moves in Tournament, 15 moves in Squad Fight, 20 moves in Sprits, and the bounus 25 from Master Mode. The reason why the numbers are like this because brawl is for begginers like level 1, Tournament is level 2, Squad Fight is level 3 and Sprits is level 4. There is a mode where that you can only do if you have all the moves called Master Mode.</p></div>
        <div><h2>Fighting</h2></div>
        <div class="Par-3"><p>The way you fight is pretty simple. If you have 2-16 players/com you will be able to have them fight in matches you choose. You can have people fight others that they have never fought before so they do not know how the other person fights. This can make the game more challenging and fun. This is how you can be creative with stratgey in this game.</p></div>
        <div><h2>Earning Different Freaks</h2></div>
        <div class="Par-3"><p>Earning different freaks isn't easy unless you're really good at the game, Because different freaks can sometimes overwelm you because you've might have not fought them before. There is more then a 30 characters so far and there will be more as the game progresses and grows. You might lose some fights and think that you can't fight them again, but in the options menu you can choose to fight them again. If you want to talk to your opponments you can use chat or use discord to talk.</p></div>
        <div><h2>Freak Making</h2></div>
        <div class="Par-3"><p>Freak Making could be for you. Freak making can be very exciting for some people. You can use other parts of other freaks if you can't come up with anything of your own. Or if you want to start from strach you can do that. I would prefer doing it from strach because you can be yourself and don't have to worry about it being bad, most people would think that it's freaky which is fine because this game is called Fighting Freaks.</p></div>
        <div><h2>Having Fun</h2></div>
        <div class="Par-3"><p>First of all never forget the most important rule have fun. If you are taking this game seriously then you should loosen up relax. If you are serious then you should  try to relax because if you aren't having fun then you aren't enjoying yourself and you should because the game's better if you are relaxed. That is why you should have fun while playing this game.</p></div>
        <div><h2>Rules</h2></div>
        <div class="Par-3"><p>Besides having fun there are other rules.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>No Cyber-Bulling</li>
