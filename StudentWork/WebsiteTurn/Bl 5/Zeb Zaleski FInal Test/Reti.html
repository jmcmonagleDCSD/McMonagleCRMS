<h1>What is the Reti Opening?</h1>
<p>
The Reti Opening is starting out with the knight instead of a pawn.<br>
This is my favourite opening because it has a lot of shock to it to the defense.<br>
It is quite common but is very good.<br>
Unlike Queen or King pawn opeing you already have a devolped knight.<br>

<h1>How to Defend against the Reti Openings</h1>
<p>
The best defense against it is the Slav.<br>
The Slav is where you from a triangle of pawns.<br>
The Slav is bassically where if you take you get taken back.<br>
It is super strong when some one has a major attack plan.<br>
Here is a video of how to use the Slav.

<p>Now Obviously this would not happen but shows when white hangs their pieces and tries to attack they get attacked by the king and queen dance.</p>

<h1>How to succsesfully use the Reti Opening</h1>
<p>
When using the Reti Opening the point is to develop a piece early on.<br>
It is widely regarded for being the third best chess opening.<br>
So when using it is key to open your kings pawn next allowing a bishop and queen to be developed.<br>

Black had several missed wins but chokes in the end of playing defense.
