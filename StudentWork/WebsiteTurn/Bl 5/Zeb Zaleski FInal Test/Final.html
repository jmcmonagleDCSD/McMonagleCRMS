    <h1>The reasons for the colors on the board</h1>
<p>
The reasons for the different colors on the board are different chess sets.<br>
The King's Pawn Opening website is designed after the common chess board.<br>
Some others how ever are much cooler like the Battle of Issus Chess Set used for the Reti Opening website.<br>
And finally the Queen's Pawn website is designed after the Royal Diamond Chess Set.<br>
That is why they are designed the way they are.<br>
