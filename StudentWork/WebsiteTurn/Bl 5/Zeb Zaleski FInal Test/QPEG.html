<h1>How to defend against "Queen's Pawn Opening" with the "Englund Gambit"</h1>
<p>
What is the Englund Gambit. It is a gambit that sacrifices a pawn.<br>
The reason it is so good is because it allows checkmate in eight and utilizes your own queen very well.<br>
It only works if they take the pawn.<br>
This is how now watch the video.

<h1>How to sucssesfully use Queen's Pawn Opening</h1>
<p>
When using the Queen's Pawn Opening the ideal is to control the center but not with you king open.<br>
The most common defenses are the Queen's Gambit and the best one being the Englund Gambit.<br>
A lot of times the Queen's Gambit is played it is basically a symetrical defense.<br>
Although the Queen's Pawn Opening controls the center this opening gets a lot of hate for being much more cowardly not willing to attack with your Queen as much.<br>
Here is a video of how it works.<br>

<br> This is obviously not how the openent will play but is a good example of a win with it.<br>
