            <p>They can survive in other habitats, too, from grasslands to deserts. Jaguars make their dens in caves, canyons, and even in the ruins of old buildings. </p>

                <p> jaguars are found in 19 diferent countries. Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, United States and Venezuela. The species is believed to be extirpated from El Salvador and Uruguay.</p> <br><hr><br> <h1>Do They Live In The United States </h1>
                <p>Though the US have been included in the list of countries where jaguars live, the range of these predators in this country is highly restricted. Occasional sightings of jaguars are reported in the southwest of the US, especially in the states of Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico. The animal is protected in the country by law under the Endangered Species Act. Jaguars have been documented in southern Arizona from 2004 onwards by officials in the state. Two to three tigers were sighted in the Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge by researchers between 2004 and 2007 of which one, named as ‘Macho B’ had also been photographed earlier in 1996. Macho B was also spotted in an area southwest of Tucson in 2009. The same year, he was caught and euthanized as he was suffering badly from a kidney disease.</p>
