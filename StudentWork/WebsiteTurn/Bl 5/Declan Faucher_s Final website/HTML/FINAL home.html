            <p>Jaguars are the largest of South America's big cats and the third largest cats in the world. Their fur is usually tan or orange with black spots, called "rosettes" because they are shaped like roses. Some jaguars are so dark they don't seem to have spots.</p>

                   <p>Jaguars don’t have big litters. They typically have two cubs at one time (though they can have up to four). The cubs are born completely helpless and blind. They remain with their mother for two years as they grow and learn to hunt and take care of themselves.</p>
                    <p>Cheetahs are the first to come to mind when you think of fast runners in the animal kingdom. Jaguars can’t quite reach the 70 miles per hour of the cheetah, but they reach a very respectable 50mph. This makes them the second-fastest big cats in the world They also have an impressive ability to jump and climb when necessary.</p>

                    <p>Jaguar territories are increasingly at risk from fire, threatening both jaguars and the prey animals they rely on, further exacerbating the problems they already face. Factory farming methods are becoming increasingly common throughout the Amazon, with catastrophic consequences. Fires are often deliberately set to clear large swathes of land quickly. Once rainforests have been removed, they are replaced with monoculture crops, which are more vulnerable to wildfires than the original ecosystems. </p> 
                    <p>Unlike most domestic cats, jaguars are excellent swimmers and love the water. They can fully submerge and dive in pursuit of prey if needed and won’t hesitate to attack prey animals in the water.
