        <p class="Overveiwparagraph">In the game Destiny 2 you play as a Guardian. The Guardians are always accompanied by a small drone called a Ghost, that do various tasks for them, such as scanning the area, and alowing the player to access the quest menu. In the quest menu there are multiple quests and quest types for you to do. The first quest available to you is the main quest, which is to get through the starting area to start the main story quest. After finishing that portion of the quest, it opens up the option to go straight to the main story quest. If not, you can finish the starting quest, which is basically a tutorial. After skipping or completing the tutorial, you can go to a new area called the Tower where you unlock side quests, the main quest, and the limited time event.</p>
