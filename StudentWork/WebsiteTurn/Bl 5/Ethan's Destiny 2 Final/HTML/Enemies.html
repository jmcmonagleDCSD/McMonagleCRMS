    <div class="enemytypes"><h3>Enemy Types</h3>

    <h5>Dregs</h5>
    
    <li>The Dregs are the very first enemy you encounter in Destiny 2, appearing right after you take your first weapon, the assault rifle. The Dregs are fairly simple, shooting at you while you are far away while being able to melee you if you get too close.</li>
    
    <h5>Vandal</h5>

    <li>Vandals have a sniper rifle and shoot you from long range, dealing heavy damage, but they are very weak and nat a lot damage needs to be dealt to them to kill them.</li>

    <h5>Thrall</h5>

    <li>The Thrall is a very simple enemy. Thrall run towards you and punch you. There are a few Champion enemies in the later game that summon them.</li>

    <h5>Wretch</h5>

    <li>Wretches are probably the simplest enemies in the game, have a spear that they run at you with.</li>

    <h5>Goblins</h5>

    <li>Goblins don't deal a lot of damage on their own, but they can put sheilds on other enemies that makes it so you can't damage them until you kill the goblin.</li>

    <h5>Shanks</h5>

    <li>The Shanks are one of the first enemies you encounter in Destiny 2. The Shanks are simple enemies that fly near the player and shoot at them. You can get up close to melee them, but it's more effective to shoot them.</li>

    <p>Note: Every enemy except for the Shank has a variant for the different "species" in Destiny 2.</p>

    <h5>Phalanax</h5>

    <li>The Phalanax is a tank enemy, with slow movement speed, but high damege and high health. They also have a shield that you can break after shooting it a few times.</li>

    <h5>Legionary</h5>

    <li>The Legionary is basically a Phalanax but without the shield, but having a little bit more health since they don't have a shield. The only major difference between the two is that the legionaries have a jetpack so they have a higher amount of movement.</li>
    </div>
    <div class="Species"><h3>Species</h3>

    <h5>Hive</h5>

    <p>The first species is the Hive. Other than the original versions of these enemies, the first species you encounter is the Hive. The Hive enemies look almost paper-like in appearance and the only difference between them and the normal enemies is the health and damage they deal.</p>

    <h5>Taken</h5>

    <p>The Taken enemies appear in The Pale Heart, their appearance like a super bright star for their face and a galaxy for their body. Being the last enemy species in the first chapter they have the most amount of health and damage out of all of the enemies in the first chapter.</p>

    <h5>Vex</h5>

    <p>The Vex are in the second chapter as the first new species in that chapter looking like robots with a single red eye in the center of their head.</p>

    <h5>Fallen</h5>

    <p>The Fallen are very very similar to the normal enemies only slightly stronger.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Champions"><h3>Champions</h3>

    <h5>Unstoppable Champions</h5>

    <p>Unstoppable Champions are champions that never stagger (unless a certain type of subclass is used on them), which is when they get hit for enough damage that they stop moving for a short time.</p>

    <h5>Barrier Champions</h5>

    <p>Barrier champions are champions that have a stronger shield. Every champion has a sheild, which is basically an extra bar of health that they can regenerate after a short time.</p>

    <h5>Unstoppable Champions</h5>
    
    <p>Unstoppable champions are extremely aggresive, chasing to the other end of the map to hunt you down. Along with that, they have a 70% damage reduction property. This means that they take 70% less damage from all incoming damage sources. The only way to remove this property is to stagger them, whereupon the damage reduction is removed.</p>
