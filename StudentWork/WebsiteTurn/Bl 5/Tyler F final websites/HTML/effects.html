     <h1>Effects</h1>
         <p id="p1">Effects can be added to anything. They can make a higher pitch or they can
             make a certain sound effect to add to a song.
              They can be very useful, especially to poppy songs.</p>
     <h2>Drum effects</h2>
     <p id="p1">Most drum effects are often used on the snare.
         They can be used to create a "smack' or a "pop" sound. Others are often used
     on the kick drum to make a higher/lower pitch sound effect.
      The cymbals often have sound effects to change the sound as well.</p>
     <h2>Guitar effects</h2>
     <p id="p1">Often, guitar effects include working with pitches and certain sounds.
         You can make a guitar sound a little different 
     using effects like those of a synthesizer, just more limited in number.</p>
     <h2>Microphone effects</h2>
     <p id="p1">Microphone effects can make you sound a little different
         and can change your voice from a little robotic to a little smoother to
         a little higher or lower in pitch.</p>
