     <p>The <strong>microphone</strong> is, of course, your voice, but being amplified in volume. This is often the highlight of a song. The microphone is
         often the most important and complex instrument, being involved with your voice. Often, the lyrics, or words you are saying in a song,
         are related to a certain highlight or occurence in a person's life. You can modify the lyrics to be anything you want them to be.</p>
         <h2>Lyric/song types</h2>
         <h3>Rapping</h3>
         <p id="p1">Rapping is a type of song where you say words that rhyme very fast. Often you couple this type of song with a bass and drum beat,
         but not much else. These songs often describe rough situations in a person's life, but they can be about anything.</p>
         <h3>Love song</h3>
         <p id="p2">Normally love songs are sung with a slow beat, with the lyrics relating to the person's affection for the other.
         These are nicely coupled with synthesizers and bass beats.</p>
         <h3>Rock/heavy metal</h3>
         <p id="p3">Heavy metal is often coupled with electric guitars and drum beats. Often the drum is the highlight of the song in 
         this type of song, as well as the lyrics. The lyrics in this song type often will refer to love or intense emotion of a person.
         These types of songs work well with any type of topic, though, and often made this way.</p>
         <h3>Pop</h3>
         <p id="p4">Pop is often made from a catchy beat with synthesizers, bass lines, and drums. These songs will often be reffered to
         as the types that get stuck inside one's head, so pop is a very popular genre because of its catchiness. The lyrics often include
         a special time or event, or a love song.</p> 
         <h3>Country</h3>
         <p id="p5">Country music is music coupled with acoustic guitars and synthesizers to make a song that seems poppy, but is also a little
         rustic and country-sounding. These are often love songs sung to the spouse/boyfriend/girlfriend of a person, but can also be sung well as stories
         of one's experiences, especially those involving being out in the wild.</p>
         <h3>Techno</h3>
         <p id="p6">Techno consists of bass and synthesizer sounds that sound a little "funky", which is why it often
         has a robotic tone to it. These songs often have lyrics like those of pop.</p>
